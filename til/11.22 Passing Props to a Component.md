React components use props to communicate with each other. 

Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.

**Props are the information that we pass to a JSX tag.**

We can pass any JavaScript value through props, including objects, arrays, and functions.

For example, `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props we can pass to an `<img/>`.

```jsx
function Avatar() {
    return (
        <img 
            className="avatar"
            src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
            alt="Lin Lanying"
            width={100}
            height={100}
        />
    );
}

export default function Profile() {
    return (
        <Avatar />
    );
}
```

However, in this code the `Profile` component isn't passing any props to its child component `Avatar`.

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar />  // not passing any props
  );
}
```

You can give props to `Avatar` in two steps.

1. Pass props to the child component (It is like passing arguments)

Pass some props to `Avatar`. For example, let's pass two props: `person`(object), and `size`(a number).

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar 
      person={{ name: "Jinsung", imageId: "kjs29" }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

2. Read props inside the child component (It is like defining parameters)

We can read these props by listing their names `person, size` separated by the commas inside `({` and `})` directly after `function Avatar`. 

This lets us use them inside the `Avatar` code, like we would with a variable.

```jsx
function Avatar ({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```

Now let's see the whole code that includes `passing props to the child components` and `reading props inside the child component`.

```jsx
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

function Avatar ({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img 
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Avatar 
        size={100}
        person={{
          name: 'Random name1',
          imageId: 'aaa'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar 
        size={80}
        person={{
          name: 'Random name2',
          imageId: 'bbb'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar 
        size={60}
        person={{
          name: 'Random name3',
          imageId: 'ccc'
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how `Profile` component passes down props to `Avatar`.

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar 
      size={100}
      person={{
        name: "Random name1",
        imageId: "aaa"
      }}
    />
    // ...
  );
}
```

Also, `Avatar` reads the props.

```jsx
function Avatar ({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img 
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}
```

Think of *props* as arguments for functions.

Earlier we defined steps to give `Avatar` some props.

- 1. Passing arguments in the parent component that has `Avatar` in it.

- 2. Defining parameters in the child component.

React component functions accept only a single argument. a `props` object.

```jsx
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
}
```

Usually we don't need the whole `props` object itself, so we destructure it into individual props.

The following two codes serve the same purpose.

```jsx
function Avatar({ person, size }) { // this takes one argument but with destructuring.

}
```

```jsx
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
}
```
### Specifying a default value for a prop

*Example*

```jsx
function Avatar({ person, size = 100 }) {

}
```

The default value is only used when 

- `size` is undefined, or

- `size` prop is missing

### Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax

```jsx
function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar
        person={person}
        size={size}
        isSepia={isSepia}
        thickBorder={thickBorder}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The document says at times we may value conciseness at times, so to forward all of the props to their children, we could simply use spread syntax.

```jsx
function Profile(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar {...props}>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The code above allows the parent component to pass down all of the props without listing all of their names.

However, the document also specifies that use spread syntax with restraint. If we use it every other component, something is wrong. Often it indicates that we should split components and pass children as JSX, which leads to the next part.

### Passing JSX as children

It is common to nest built-in browser tags,


```html
<div>
  <img />
</div>
```


Sometimes we want to nest our own components the same way.

```jsx
<Card>
  <Avatar />
</Card>
```

When you nest content insdie a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called `children`. For example, the `Card` component below will receive a `chilren` prop set to `<Avatar />` and render it in a wrapper div:

*Example.*

```jsx
function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: "2px solid black", backgroundColor: "lightblue" }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

function Picture() {
  return (
    <img src="google.com" />
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Picture />
    </Card>
  );
}
```

How the above exmple works:


1. `App` component renders a `Card` component.

2. Inside the `Card` component, it places `Picture` component as the child.

3. `Picture` component renders an image.

In HTML,

```html
<div style="border: 2px solid black; backgroundColor= lightblue">
  <img src="google.com" />
</div>
```

The `Picture` component is passed as the children prop to the `Card` component and rendered where `{children}` is placed.


### How props change over time

Props are immutable, but it can still change over time, as it can be dynamic.

When a component needs to change its props, it will have to ask its parent component to pass it different props - a new object.
