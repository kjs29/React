### Updating the screen

Often We want my component to remember some information and display it.


1. Import `useState` from React:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

2. Declare a state variable inside my component:

```jsx
function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
}
```

The first variable indicates the current state(`count`). The second variable indicates a function that lets us update it(`setSomething`). A naming convention is `[something, setSomething]`.

When the first time the button is displayed, `count` will be 0 because we passed 0 to `useState()`. When we want to change state, we can call `setCount()` and pass the new value to it.

```jsx
function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

We don't need to call a function, we can just pass the function down. React will call the function for us.

We can have multiple buttons, and each component will get its own state.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

Notice how each button "remembers" its own `count` state and doesn't affect other buttons.



### Hooks

Functions that start with `use` are called **Hooks**. `useState` is a built-in hook provided by React. We can find other built-in books in the `API reference`. We can write our own hooks by combining the existing ones.

Hooks have more rules to follow. We can only call hooks at the top of our components(or other hooks). If we want to use `useState` in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.

### Sharing data between components

In the previous example, each button had its own state and the count for the button changed independently.

However, often we want the components to share data and always update it together.

To make both `MyButton` components display the same count and update together, we need to move the state from the individual buttons "upward" to the closest component containing all of them.

1. Move the state up from `MyButton` into `MyApp`

```jsx
export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // move the state up

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton() {
    // ...we're moving code from here...
}
```


2. Pass the state down from `MyApp` to each `MyButton`, together with the shared click handler.

We can pass information to `MyButton` using the curly braces.

```jsx
export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton count={count} onClikc={handleClick} />  
      <MyButton count={count} onClikc={handleClick} /> 
    </div>
  );
}
```

The information we pass down like this is called `props`. 

Now the MyApp component contains the `count` state and the `handleClick` event handler, and passes both of them down as props to each buttons.

3. Change `MyButton` to read the props we have passed from its parent component.

```jsx
function MyButton({count, onClick}) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

Flow:

Click the button -> `handleClick()` inside the `MyApp()` runs -> `setCount(count + 1)` is called, incrementing `count` variable inside the `MyApp()` -> The new `count` variable is passed as a prop to each button, and all the buttons show the new value.
