### What are components?

Components: Reusable building UI elements.

### How is React different than original websites?

Original website developers marked up their content, then added some interaction by sprinkling on some javascript. React puts `interactivity` first. React component is a **JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup**.


### How to build a component?

We learned that component is a javascript function.

1. Export

2. Define the function

3. Add markup

Let's go over what each step actually looks like.

1. Export

In JavaScript, we can export function using `export { functionName }`, or `export default functionName`. Refer to (11.19 basics)[https://github.com/kjs29/React/blob/master/til/11.19%20basics.md#i-will-talk-about-export-default-briefly].

```jsx
export default functionName;
```

```jsx
export { functionName };
```

2. Define the function

First, name the function. The name should be relatable to what the function achieves. Component name (JavaScript function name) must start with a capital letter otherwise it won't work.

```jsx
export default Profile;
```

Then initialize like how we learned JavaScript.

```jsx
export default Profile {

};
```

3. Add markup

In HTML, `<img/>` tag has `src` and `alt` attributes. In React, we let a component return what we want to render on the screen. Let's say we render an image, we return `<img/>` tag, but inside of parentheses. React component returns a single root element like `<div>...</div>` or an empty tag `<>...</>`. Inside the single root element, we can still include many nested elements.

```jsx
export default Profile {

  return (  // wrapped inside parentheses
    <div>   // single root element
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now we have just created the first component `Profile`! 

This component can nest it inside other component.

```jsx
function Profile {
  return (  // wrapped inside parentheses
    <div>   // single root element
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Gallery {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Awesome People</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

In this `Gallery` component, we used one single root element: `<section/>`. Inside the root element, we included `<h1/>`, and `<Profile />`. When an element starts with a capital letter, React knows that the element is a component.

`Gallery` Component is a parent component, and `Profile` component is a child component. 

We must not define any component within another component. We must define components at the top level.

```jsx
// Bad example

export default function Gallery() {

    function Profile() {
        //...
    }
}
```

```jsx
// good example

export default function Gallery() {
    // ...
}

function Profile() {
    // ...
}
```

When a child component needs some data from a parent component, we pass it by props instead of nesting definitions.
