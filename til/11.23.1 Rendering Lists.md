Rendering lists

Rendering data from arrays

We have a list of content.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Hello</li>
  <li>World</li>
  <li>React</li>
</ul>
```

### How to generate a list of items from an array

1. Create an array of data

```jsx
const sentence = [
  'Hello', 'World', 'React'
]
```

2. Map the array into a new array of JSX nodes.

```jsx
const items = sentence.map(word => <li>{word}</li>);
```

3. Return `items` from component wrapped in a `ul`

```jsx
return <ul>{items}</ul>
```

The whole code looks like this.

```jsx
const sentence = [
  'Hello', 'World', 'React'
]

export default function List() {
  const items = sentence.map(word => <li>{word}</li>);
  return <ul>{items}</ul>;
}
```

Now let's go over `filter` array method to render items with specific criteria.

```jsx
const people = [{
  id:0, name: "A", profession: "Associate lawyer"
}, {
  id:1, name: "B", profession: "CTO"
}, {
  id:2, name: "C", profession: "SWE"
}, {
  id:3, name: "D", profession: "SWE"
}]

export default function SoftwareEngineer() {
  const swe = people.filter(person => {
    if (person.profession === "SWE") {
      return person;
    }
  });

  const softwareEngineers = swe.map(person => {
    <li>
      Name: {person.name}
      Id: {person.id}
    </li>
  })

  return <ul>{softwareEngineers}</ul>;
}
```

### Keeping list items in order with `key`

We need to give each array item a `key` - a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array

```jsx
<li kkey={person.id}>...</li>
```

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if our array items can move, get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen `key` helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.

Rather than generating keys on the fly, we should include them in our data.

```jsx
export const people = [{
  id: 0, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',
  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'
}, {
  id: 3, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',
  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

### Rules of keys

- Keys must be unique among sibligns

- Keys must not change - Do NOT generate them while rendering.


### Bad example of generating keys

Never use an item's index in the array as its key.

```jsx
// bad example

const alphabets = [
  "A", "B", "C"
]

export default function SayHello() {
  const greetings = alphabets.map((alphabet, index) => {
    return (
      <li key={index}>
        <p>Hello, {alphabet}</p>
      </li>
    );
  });

  return <ul>{greetings}</ul>;
}
```

It is a bad practice because we might need to modify `alphabets`, then `keys` which are index number will be useless. React relies on keys to decide which items in the list to update, delete, or re-render.
