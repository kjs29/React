JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.

For a long time, websites have been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. React helps websites to be rendered on logic effectively as websites became more and more interactive.

### The rules of JSX

1. Return a single root element

```jsx
return (
  <h1>Thank you!</h1>
  <h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
);
```

The code above is a bad example.

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Thank you!</h1>
    <h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
  </div>
);
```

If we don't want to wrap it around with `<div/>` tag, we can wrap it with an empty tag. We call it `fragment`.

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <h1>Thank you!</h1>
    <h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
  </>
);
```
